# ProjetFinalDocker

The purpose of this project were to set-up a Virtual Machine and a container to make use of two databases interfaces: PhpMyAdmin and PgAdmin.

To do that, we did all the configuration needed. We've downloaded the four images: MySQL, PostgreSQL, PhpMyAdmin and PgAdmin. By making use of all commands necessary to setup our environment we were able to use the interfaces to create and charge our tables and after that, to use the connection allowed by Microsoft Power BI to reat a Dashboard with our initial and treated data.

Here you have allm the presentation of this project as images:
